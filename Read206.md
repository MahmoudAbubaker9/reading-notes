# OBJECT

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

**IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES AND FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS**

# Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.

It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:

- MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE

- ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE

The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably
but when people say the DOM is working with an element,
it is actually working with a node that represents that element.

**ACCESSING ELEMENTS**

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes

## METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE

1- getElementByld ('id')

2- querySelector( 'css selector ')

3- querySelectorAll  ( 'css selector ')

4- getElementsByClassName( 'class')

5- getElementsByTagName('TagName')

**Exapmle: document.getElementByld ('id')**

## NODELISTS: DOM QUERIES THAT RETURN MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT

When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a
Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).

**SELECTING AN ELEMENT FROM A NODELIST**

There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelist:

1- THE item()) METHOD

Nodelists have a method
called item() which will return
an individual node from the
Node list.

2- Array syntax (the preferd)

**TRAVERSING THE DOM**

When you have an element node, you can select
another element in relation to it using these five
properties. This is known as traversing the DOM

1- parentNode

2- previousSibling - nextSibling

3- firstChild - lastChild 

Traversing the DOM can be difficult because
some browsers add a text node whenever they
come across whitespace between elements.

**HOW TO GET/UPDATE ELEMENT CONTENT**

To work with the content of elements you can:

• Navigate to the text nodes. This works best
when the element contains only text, no other
elements.

• Work with the containing element. This allows
you to access its text nodes and child elements.
It works better when an element has text nodes
and child elements that are siblings.

**When you select a text node, you can retrieve or amend the content of it using the node Va 1 ue property.**

### Remove and add HTML contact

1- innerHTML : there are security risks associated with using innerHTML

2- maniplation : can be safer than using innerHTML but it requires more code and acn be slower


**CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) ATTACKS**


If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML (or several jQuery methods),
you need to be aware of Cross-Site Scripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise,
an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.


**DEFENDING AGAINST CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING**

VALIDATE INPUT GOING TO THE SERVER

1- Only let visitors input the kind
of characters they need to when
supplying information. This is
known as validation. Do not
allow untrusted users to submit
HTML markup or JavaScript.

2- Double-check validation on
the server before displaying user
content/storing it in a database.
This is important because users
could bypass validation in the
browser by turning JavaScript off.

3- The database may safely
contain markup and script
from trusted sources (e.g., your
content management system).
This is because it does not try to
process the code; it just stores it.

4- As your data leaves the
database, all potentially
dangerous characters should be
escaped.

5- Make sure that you are only
inserting content generated by
users into certain parts of the
template files

6- Do not create DOM fragments
containing HTML from untrusted
sources. It should only be added
as text once it has been escaped.

**REMOVING ATTRIBUTES**

To remove an attribute from an
element, first select the element,
then call removeAtt r i bute () .
It has one parameter: the name
of the attribute to remove.
