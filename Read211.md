# Images

**controlling sizes of images in CSS**

You can control the size of an
image using the *width* and
*height* properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box. 

Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images

**Centering images Using CSS**

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.

> display: block; //
margin: 0px auto;

**background-image**

The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.


**background-repeat**

The background-repeat
property can have four values:

1- repeat :

The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically 

2- repeat-x :

The image is repeated
horizontally only

3- repeat-y :

The image is repeated vertically
only

4- no-repeat :

The image is only shown once.

5- fixed

The background image stays in
the same position on the page.

6- scroll

The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.

**background-position**

When an image is not being
repeated, you can use the
background-position
property to specify where in the
browser window the background
image should be placed. 


* Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it. 

# Practical Information

**How to Identify Keywords and Phrases**

Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.

1- Brainstorm
List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.

2- Organize
Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.

3- Research
There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to
consider,

4- Compare
It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of
the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.

5- Refine
Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.

6- Map
Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.

* Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there

## Domain Names & Hosting

In order to put your site on the web you will
need a domain name and web hosting

**DOMAIN Names**

Your domain name is your web
address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
co.uk). There are many websites
that allow you to register domain
names. Usually you will have to
pay an annual fee to keep that
domain name.

**WEB Hosting**

So that other people can see
your site, you will need to upload
it to a web server. Web servers
are special computers that are
constantly connected to the
Internet. They are specially set
up to serve web pages when
they are requested.

**FTP & Third Party Tools**

To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol.

As the name suggests, File
Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows
you to transfer files across the
Internet from your computer to
the web server hosting your site. 

# HTML5 video and audio

The (video) and (audio) elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages

* The time display currently breaks if the video is an hour long or more (well, it won't display hours; just minutes and seconds)

* Because audio elements have the same HTMLMediaElement functionality available to them, you could easily get this player to work for an audio element too

**Flash**

Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very
popular tool for creating animations, and later
for playing audio and video in websites.

Since 2005, a number of factors have meant
that fewer websites are written in Flash or even
use elements of Flash in their pages.
