## text editor

A text editor is a software that allows you to write and manage text, to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools

**What features in a text editor?**

1.) code completion

2.) syntax highlighting

3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)

4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

There is a kind of *shorthand language called **Emmet** * that
can help. **Emmet** will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with **Emmet** built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension

>Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”


**The Shell, Bash**

operating system that defines how the terminal will behave ,There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell.

If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called echo to display a system variable stating your current shell.

**pwd command** 
pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that.

**ls. command **
The command for this task is ls. It's short for list
Whereas pwd is just run by itself with no arguments, ls is a little more powerful. We have run it here with no arguments in which case it will just do a plain listing of our current location

>pwd

>Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

>ls

>List the contents of a directory.

>cd

>Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.


**path**

Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. ie. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.


**Linux is an Extensionless System**
Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.

**Linux is Case Sensitive** As such it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.
