# OO Design

### Don't repeat yourself

* every repetitive behavior in the code can and should be extracted

* Having two fragments of the same code in your codebase isn't good. It can often lead to bugs happening in the code

* Write Everything Twice (WET) is a cheeky abbreviation to mean the opposite i.e. code that doesnâ€™t adhere to DRY principle.

### Rule of three (computer programming)

is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. 

### You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)

statement that some capability we presume our software needs in the future should not be built now because "you aren't gonna need it".

### Minimum viable product (MVP)

a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get the attention of the consumers.
