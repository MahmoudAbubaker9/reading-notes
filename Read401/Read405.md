# Linked Lists

### Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

we mainly used to measure and compare the worst-case theoretical running time complexities of algorithms for the performance analysis. 

* The fastest possible running time for any algorithm is O(1).

* In actual cases, the performance (Runtime) of an algorithm depends on n

* The higher this number (n), the more likely there will be an increase to Running Time and Memory Space.

* the size of the input or the number of operations is required for each input item. 

**we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:**

1- Input Size

2- Units of Measurement

3- Orders of Growth

4- Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

**Orders of Growth type:**

1- Constant Complexity

2- Logarithmic Complexity

3- Linear Complexity

### Linked Lists

**What is a Linked List**

A linked List is a linear data structure and The elements in a linked are linked using pointers and There are two types of Linked List :

* Singly : means that there is only one reference (Next) node
* Doubly : means that there is a reference to both (Next,Previous) node

**Traversal**

When traversing a linked list we depend on the next value im each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing


**Linear data structures**

* linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

* non-linear data structures, items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order

**Memory Management** 

is the process of allocation and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management. Java does memory management automatically
