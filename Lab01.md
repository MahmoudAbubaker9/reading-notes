## There are two types of mindset

1- fixed mindset people believe that their talant are fixed and therefore cannot be changed

2- growth mindest it is the belief that persons abilities and intelligence can be developed through practice, hard work and motivation

## Why is mindset important in developing positive habits?

the fixed beliefs will prevent you from making any positive change. If you have a trait that you think you cannot change, such as bad habits, you will avoid situations that may be uncomfortable or that you think are useless.

## And you can develop a growth mindset By:
* Acknowledge and embrace your weaknesses.
* I see challenges as opportunities.

*We make important decisions, such as accepting a new job or registering for a new semester.
Meeting these distinct challenges is one of growing up as a person. We must learn it ourselves. New challenges equal new opportunities.*

> Dodging a new challenge can be frightening due to the fear of failure. This may lead to us avoiding sending him and continuing on the usual path, and enjoying the excuses we tell ourselves so that we can stay in our comfort zones.

**The truth is, staying in your comfort zone because you're afraid of getting out of it can become uncomfortable. If you avoid challenges, you will not have opportunities to learn and grow. Instead, you will be bothered by the feeling that things are not right.**
