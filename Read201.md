It is a high-level programming language that is mainly used in web browsers to create more interactive pages.
To provide web applications, including games; It is used by most websites, and is supported by almost all browsers without the need for external add-ons.

### SCRIPT

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal, and can run different sections of the code in respones to the situation around them

To write a script, we need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it, As shown below
1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP 

Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.
You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

how to create script :
A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 


### OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
**OBJECTS**
In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object.
Each object can have its own:
• Properties
• Events
• Methods 

**PROPERTIES**

Each property has a name and a value, and each of
these name/value pairs tells you something about
each individual instance of the object.

**HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT**

Web developers usually talk about three languages that
are used to create web pages:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
and Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right.
builds on the previous one.

>Html : CONTENT LAYER (.html files)

>css : PRESENTATION LAYER (.css files)

>javascript : BEHAVIOR LAYER (.js files )

PLACING THE SCRIPT
IN THE PAGE
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening "script open and closing  tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files).

When the browser comes across a script element, it stops to
load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.
